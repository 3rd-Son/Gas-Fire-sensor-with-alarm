  <h1>Gas and Fire Sensor</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to the Gas and Fire Sensor project! This README provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, features, and instructions for setting it up and using it.
  </p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <p>
    The Gas and Fire Sensor is an Arduino-based device designed to detect the presence of gas or fire and trigger an alarm. It offers the following features:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gas detection: The sensor can detect the presence of harmful gases in the environment.</li>
    <li>Fire detection: It is also capable of detecting the presence of fire or high temperatures.</li>
    <li>Alarm triggering: When gas or fire is detected, the sensor will activate an alarm connected to it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Setup Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    To set up the Gas and Fire Sensor, follow these steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Hardware connections:
      <ul>
        <li>Connect the gas and fire sensor module to the appropriate pins on your Arduino board.</li>
        <li>Connect the alarm device to the Arduino board. Ensure that it is compatible and can be triggered by the Arduino.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Software setup:
      <ul>
        <li>Install the Arduino IDE on your computer, if you haven't done so already.</li>
        <li>Connect your Arduino board to the computer using a USB cable.</li>
        <li>Open the Arduino IDE and create a new project.</li>
        <li>Copy and paste the Arduino C++ code provided for the Gas and Fire Sensor into your project.</li>
        <li>Upload the code to your Arduino board.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Once you have set up the Gas and Fire Sensor, you can use it as follows:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Ensure that the sensor is powered and connected to the Arduino board.</li>
    <li>Place the sensor in the desired location where you want to monitor for gas or fire.</li>
    <li>When the sensor detects gas or fire, it will trigger the alarm connected to it, alerting you to the potential danger.</li>
    <li>Take appropriate action based on the alarm activation, such as evacuating the area, calling emergency services, or addressing the gas/fire issue.</li>
  </ol>
